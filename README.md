# gr-strf

**gr-strf** is an out-of-tree GNURADIO module to produce time-stamped waterfall files. It will duplicate the functionality of the *rffft* tool from https://github.com/cbassa/strf.

**gr-strf** is based on the SatNOGS waterfall sink from **gr-satnogs** (https://gitlab.com/librespacefoundation/satnogs/gr-satnogs).
